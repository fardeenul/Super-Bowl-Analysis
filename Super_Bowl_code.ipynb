TV, halftime shows, and the Big Game\n","<p>Whether or not you like American football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There is always a little something for everyone. For the die-hard fans, there is the game itself with blowouts, comebacks, and controversy. For the not so die-hard fans, there are the ridiculously expensive ads that are hilarious, gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and sometimes weird. And of course, there are the halftime shows with the biggest musicians in the world entertaining us by <a href=\"https://youtu.be/ZD1QrIe--_Y?t=14\">riding a giant mechanical tiger</a> or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/mjrdywp5nyE?t=62\">leaping from the roof of the stadium</a>. It is a grand show! In this notebook, we're going to explore how some of these elements interact with each other. After exploring and cleaning the data, we're going to answer questions like:</p>\n","<ul>\n","<li>What are the most extreme game outcomes?</li>\n","<li>How does the score difference affect television viewership?</li>\n","<li>How have viewership, TV ratings, and advertisement costs evolved?</li>\n","<li>Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?</li>\n","</ul>\n","<p><img src=\"https://assets.datacamp.com/production/project_691/img/left_shark.jpg\" alt=\"Left Shark Steals The Show\">\n","<em><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/huntleypaton/16464994135/in/photostream/\">Left Shark Steals The Show</a>.
